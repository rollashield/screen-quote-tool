# Roll-A-Shield — Screen Quote PDF Template Design Prompt

Use this prompt in Figma, Canva, or an AI design tool (like v0.dev) to create the customer-facing estimate/purchase agreement PDF.

---

## DESIGN BRIEF

Design a **one-page** customer estimate / purchase agreement PDF for Roll-A-Shield, a rolling screen and shutter company based in Arizona (established 1979). This document serves as both a quote and a purchase agreement — it's what the customer reviews, signs, and pays from.

The design should feel **professional, clean, and modern** — not like an invoice or spreadsheet. Think high-end home improvement contractor, not generic office supply template. It needs to fit on a single page (US Letter, 8.5" × 11") even with 4–5 screens listed.

- **Left side:** Roll-A-Shield horizontal logo (white version for dark background)
- **Right side:** Company address, phone, website, license number — small white text

### 2. CUSTOMER INFO + QUOTE INFO
- Light gray or white background section, two-column layout
- **Left column — "PREPARED FOR":**
  - Small caps label: "PREPARED FOR"
  - Customer Name (large, bold)
  - Company (if applicable)
  - Project Address
  - Email | Phone
- **Right column — "YOUR SALES REPRESENTATIVE":**
  - Small caps label: "YOUR SALES REPRESENTATIVE"

- **Above or between these sections**, display:
  - Document title: "PROJECT ESTIMATE" with Quote Number (large, e.g., Q2502-001)
  - Date and "Valid through: [date]" right-aligned

### 3. SCREEN PRODUCT TABLE
This is the core of the document — a table listing each screen in the order.

**Columns:**
| Screen Name | Track | Operator | Fabric | Frame | Size | Price |

- **Screen Name** — e.g., "Patio Door", "Kitchen Window", "Guest Bedroom"
- **Track** — e.g., "Zipper Track", "Cable Track", "Keder Track" (NEVER include brand names like SunAir, Fenetex, Gaposa, Somfy)
- **Operator** — e.g., "Remote-Operated Motor", "Solar Motor", "Manual Gear Operation" (NEVER include brand names)
- **Fabric** — e.g., "Charcoal 90%", "Beige 80%"
- **Frame** — e.g., "Bronze", "White", "Black"
- **Size** — e.g., 18' 0" × 10' 6"
- **Price** — Right-aligned dollar amounts

**If a comparison product is selected**, the Price column splits into TWO columns, each labeled with the motor type being compared (e.g., "Remote Motor" | "Solar Motor"). Both columns show prices for every screen. The second option column should be visually distinguished (different color text, like #0071bc).

Table should have:
- Blue (#004a95) header row with white text
- Alternating row shading (white / very light gray #f8fafc)
- Clean, minimal borders

### 4. PRICING SUMMARY
- Right-aligned summary table that aligns with the price column(s) from the screen table
- Line items:
  - Materials (X screens): [subtotal]
  - Professional Installation: [amount]
  - Multi-Screen Discount (X%) — shown in green if applicable
  - **Subtotal**
  - Sales Tax: $0.00
  - **TOTAL** — bold, prominent, blue background with white text
  - Deposit (50%): [half of total]
  - Balance Due at Completion: [half of total]
- If comparison pricing is active, this section also has two columns matching the screen table price columns, with a small legend (e.g., ◆ Remote Motor  ◆ Solar Motor)
- The deposit/balance breakdown is important — it reinforces the payment terms visually

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **NEVER use internal brand names** in any customer-facing content: no SunAir, Gaposa, Somfy, Fenetex. Use generic descriptions only (Zipper Track, Cable Track, Remote-Operated Motor, Solar Motor, Manual Gear Operation, etc.)
2. Always hyphenate **Roll-A-Shield** — never "Roll A Shield" or "RollAShield"
3. Products are called **rolling screens** or **motorized screens** — never "roller shields" or "solar screens"
4. Everything must fit on **one page** (US Letter 8.5" × 11") with reasonable margins
5. The design needs to work with **1 to 5 screens** in the table — it should scale gracefully
6. The comparison pricing columns are **optional** — design should work cleanly with a single price column too
